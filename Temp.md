What I did (files created)

- Root
  - package.json — npm workspace scripts (dev:web, dev:api, concurrently).
  - turbo.json — simple Turborepo pipeline placeholder.
  - docker-compose.yml — Postgres service (postgres:15).
  - README.md — quick run instructions for Windows cmd.exe.
  - .prettierrc
- /apps/api
  - package.json — express, ws, prisma deps and scripts.
  - `.env` — DATABASE_URL and PORT (points to docker-compose Postgres).
  - `index.js` — Express server and WebSocket server on path `/ws`. In-memory rooms, join/leave/message handling and member broadcasts (POC).
  - `prisma/schema.prisma` — Prisma models: User, Group, GroupMember, Message.
- /apps/web
  - package.json — Next.js + React + Tailwind dev deps.
  - `pages/_app.js` — app wrapper + global CSS import.
  - `pages/index.js` — `/home` page (shows servers, groups, username input, links to mocks).
  - `pages/chat/mock.js` — `/chat/mock` 1:1 chat mock UI, connects to `ws://localhost:3001/ws`.
  - `pages/groupchat/mock.js` — `/groupchat/mock` multi-user chat mock UI, similar to 1:1 but intended for many users.
  - `styles/globals.css`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js` — minimal Tailwind setup.

What works now (POC)

- The API server (index.js) exposes:
  - HTTP health check: GET /api/health
  - WebSocket endpoint: ws://localhost:3001/ws
  - WebSocket message types (JSON):
    - join: { type: 'join', room, username } → server responds with joined + members + history and broadcasts member_joined
    - leave: { type: 'leave', room }
    - message: { type: 'message', room, text, sender } → broadcast to room and appended to in-memory history
    - list: { type: 'list', room } → get members + history
- Frontend pages connect with native WebSocket and implement the simple UX: username, message input, message list (sender + timestamp), member list.

Notes, assumptions, and trade-offs

- I used native WebSocket server (`ws`) not Socket.IO. Reason: you asked for WebSocket `/ws`; `ws` is lightweight and simple for a POC. If you meant Socket.IO explicitly, I can swap it.
- Rooms and messages are in-memory on the server (no DB writes). This matches your request for a mocked POC. Prisma schema is added for later persistence.
- I created a Turborepo placeholder (turbo.json) and npm workspaces in package.json. I didn't install dependencies or run builds here.
- Tailwind files are present; you'll need to run `npm install` in workspaces to enable CSS processing.

Next recommended steps (run & verify)

1. Start Postgres:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
2. Install dependencies (root will install workspace packages):
   ```
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Start the API:

   - Open a terminal (cmd.exe) in project root:
     ```
     pnpm run dev:api
     ```
     This starts the Express + WS server on port 3001 (default in `.env`).

4. Start the Next web app in another terminal:

   ```
   pnpm run dev:web
   ```

   Next runs on port 3000.

5. Open browser:
   - Home: http://localhost:3000/ — set a username then click "Open 2-user mock chat" or join a group.
   - The chat pages connect to ws://localhost:3001/ws and demonstrate join/leave/message flows.

Quality gates / quick checks

- I haven't run `npm install` or started servers from this environment, so build/run not executed here.
- There may be minor lint notices for Tailwind CSS at file-creation time — that's expected until you run the build and install Tailwind tooling.

Files changed/created (quick list)

- package.json (root) — workspace + scripts
- turbo.json
- docker-compose.yml
- README.md
- apps/api/{package.json,index.js,.env,prisma/schema.prisma}
- apps/web/{package.json,pages/\_app.js,pages/index.js,pages/chat/mock.js,pages/groupchat/mock.js,styles/globals.css,tailwind.config.js,postcss.config.js}
- .prettierrc

What's next I can do (pick one; I can proceed automatically)

- Run a quick local smoke test: run `npm install` and start api + web here (I can run them in terminals if you want me to). This will validate the WebSocket flows end-to-end.
- Swap `ws` for Socket.IO if you prefer that API.
- Wire Prisma (generate client, run migrations) and persist messages/members in Postgres.
- Add a tiny automated test or script that simulates two WebSocket clients exchanging messages (useful for CI/demo).

Which next step do you want me to take now? If you'd like me to run the servers and validate the connection here, say “Run the servers and test the chat” and I'll start them and report back with the quick verification results. Next runs on port 3000.
